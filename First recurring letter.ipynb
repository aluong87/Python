"""
A simple function that finds the first recurring letter found in a given string.
It returns a new string with letters that appears more than once.
If the function does not find any recurring letters, then it will return None.
The function first creates a frequency table for a given string and an empty string.
Then goes through a loop to find if the value of that key (letter) is more than one.
If the value is indeed greater than one, it will add the key to the empty string.
If the new string is empty, the function returns 'No recurring letters.'
I chose to create a frequency table rather than looping through a given string
character by character as it takes less time to iterate through a dictionary.
